            <p>TESLA MOTORS was founded in 2003 by a group of Silicon Valley engineers who set out to prove that electric vehicles could be awesome! The Tesla Roadster hit the streets in early 2008 as a sports car that can go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and travel for 245 miles per charge. </p><br />
        <p>since Tesla Motors founding the company has been at the forefront of eco friendly cars, putting the fear of god into major car manafacturer world wide. making ford's gas guzzling, planet punching cars look stupid. Social outlook on cars has changed worldwide ever since a bunch of scrawny nerds from Silicon Valley startdd this company</p><br />
   <blockquote><p>The human being is a self-propelled automaton entirely under the control of external influences. Willful and predetermined though they appear, his actions are governed not from within, but from without. He is like a float tossed about by the waves of a turbulent sea.  -Nikola Tesla

        <p>When Conor and Jonathan set out to create this website they thought not of what this site could do for them, but rather what they could do for this site! </p><br />
        
          <p>with a combination of blind ambition, a pot of coffee and a packet of amberleaf this page was formed. we here at Tesla fan site we strive for excellence, anything else is seen as failure, when we set out to create this site we decided on one site... one site.. to rule them all</p></div>
